* About DTOS
#+CAPTION: DTOS Scrot
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt DTOS scrot :title DTOS Scrot :align left
[[https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/-/raw/master/.screenshots/dtos-thumb-01.png]]

DTOS is the name that I have chosen for my post-installation script that will deploy my Qtile config, my Emacs config, as well as associated programs that are needed to create a proper "desktop" experience.  DTOS should work on Arch Linux or any Arch-based distribution.  The programs that will be installed include qtile, dmscripts, emacs, fish and many other programs needed to recreate DT's Qtile desktop.  DTOS is only for x86_64 architecture and will not work on ARM devices such as the Raspberry Pi.

* Installing DTOS
** Installation instructions
To install DTOS, you need to clone this repository and run the ~dtos~ script.
#+begin_example
git clone https://gitlab.com/dtos/dtos
cd dtos/
./dtos
#+end_example

** Potential bugs
*** Does DTOS run on Artix?
No.  Arch Linux and its popular derivatives (Arco, Endeavour, Garuda, Manjaro, etc.) all use systemd.  After all, it is a Linux standard now and virtually all of the mainstream distros use systemd.  Artix is unique in that it is a =protest distro= and a fork of Arch built around the dislike of systemd.  The DTOS installation script assumes that systemd is installed and does try to execute some systemctl commands.  Also, some of the programs that are installed (like dmscripts) assume systemd is installed. While I have no issue with a =protest distro= like Artix existing, I am not interested in trying to make DTOS work with it at this time.
*** Slow download times.
This script can take a long time to complete since it will install more than 300 packages.  Also, make sure that the Linux distro that you are installing this on uses ParallelDownloads in /etc/pacman.conf for faster download times!  For an example, to enable ParallelDownloads so it downloads up to five packages at a time:

#+begin_example
ParallelDownloads = 5
#+end_example
*** Package conflicts that cause the script to fail
+ shell-color-scripts (from dtos-core-repo) conflicts with shell-color-scripts from the AUR.
+ dtos-opendoas (from dtos-core-repo) conflicts with opendoas from the Arch repos.

The solution is, before running the script, edit the pkglist.txt file and remove the packages above.

*** Emacs doesn't launch.
After the installation is completed, Emacs may not launch correctly the very first time.  Killing the Emacs server (if running) and restarting it fixes this.
#+begin_example
killall emacs
/usr/bin/emacs --daemon &
#+end_example

* Updating DTOS
DTOS is updated in the standard way as all Arch-based Linux distros:
#+begin_example
sudo pacman -Syu
#+end_example

Many DTOS packages are configuration files.  Those packages install their config files to /etc/dtos since we don't want to overwrite your config files accidentally.  If you want to use the updated configs, then you need to manually copy the configs from /etc/dtos into $HOME.

=NOTE:= There is no need to run the DTOS script more than once.  If you have successfully installed DTOS, then you already have access to the [[https://gitlab.com/dtos/dtos-core-repo][DTOS core repository]] and all of the DTOS packages.  If a newer version of DTOS installs packages that your version did not, then just install those packages yourself using pacman.

* Contributing to DTOS
Community contributions to the DTOS script is welcomed.  There are a few things to consider before making a merge request.
** Edit README.org
I understand that non-Emacs users may be confused with the way literate programming works, but the actual DTOS script is ~README.org~ which gets converted to ~dtos~.  So the file you should edit is ~README.org~ and not ~dtos~.  Through the magic of Org Mode in Emacs, ~README.org~ gets converted to ~dtos~.  If you edit ~dtos~ (and not ~README.org~) and make a merge request, then I have to manually edit ~README.org~ to make it conform to your proposed changes.  For a big merge, this is a lot work and could lead to mistakes being made in copying/pasting your changes.

To help non-Emacs users, there is a script in this repo (~convert.sh~) that will convert ~README.org~ into ~dtos~.  This will allow you to edit ~README.org~ in whatever editor that you prefer, and then convert it to see if exports to ~dtos~ correctly.
** Test your changes before pushing
It would be a good idea to keep a clean installation of an Arch-based distro in a virtual machine, and then clone that clean VM when you need to test the script.  Please don't do a merge request without attempting to run the script in a fresh VM (one that you haven't previously ran the script on).

# NAME: DTOS
# DESC: An installation and deployment script for DT's Qtile desktop.
# WARNING: Run this script at your own risk.
# DEPENDENCIES: libnewt (probably already on the system)

#+end_src
* Check that user is NOT root!
Don't run this script as root!  This is done for safety reasons.  This script makes a lot of changes to the $HOME of the $USER of this script.  For obvious reasons, we want $USER to not be 'root' and $HOME not to be '/root'.  Instead, run this script as a normal user.  You will be asked to enter a sudo password at several points during the installation.

#+begin_src bash
if [ "$(id -u)" = 0 ]; then
    echo "##################################################################"
    echo "This script MUST NOT be run as root user since it makes changes"
    echo "to the \$HOME directory of the \$USER executing this script."
    echo "The \$HOME directory of the root user is, of course, '/root'."
    echo "We don't want to mess around in there. So run this script as a"
    echo "normal user. You will be asked for a sudo password when necessary."
    echo "##################################################################"
    exit 1
fi

#+end_src

* Font Effects
Use these variables within 'echo' or 'printf' to bold text or to make text normal again.

#+begin_src bash
bold=$(tput setaf 2 bold)      # makes text bold and sets color to 2
bolderror=$(tput setaf 3 bold) # makes text bold and sets color to 3
normal=$(tput sgr0)            # resets text settings back to normal

#+end_src

* A function for errors
#+begin_src bash
error() { \
    printf "%s\n" "${bolderror}ERROR:${normal}\\n%s\\n" "$1" >&2; exit 1;
}

#+end_src

* Whiptail Exports
These exports are the only way to specify colors with whiptail.
See this thread for more info:

* Checking locale.conf
For some users, the LC_CTYPE variable is needed in the /etc/locale.conf for some programs (like dmenu) to work properly.  The following checks if the LC_CTYPE has been set.  If it has not been set, it will automatically be created using the same value as your LANG variable.  Then, a 'sudo locale-gen' will be run to generate the new locale settings.  These will take effect upon a reboot which should be done anyway once the DTOS installation has completed.
#+begin_src bash
grep "LC_CTYPE" /etc/locale.conf && echo "Checking LC_CYPE in /etc/locale.conf. Variable is already set." || \

* Install the base packages from repositories
All packages listed are either in the standard Arch repos, the Chaotic AUR or in the DTOS repos.  All of these can be installed using pacman.  Two AUR helpers (aura and paru) are also installed and are needed if installing packages from the standard AUR.

=NOTE:= The '--ask 4' option is an undocumented option for pacman that can be found in pacman's source code (in pacman's alpm.h).  Adding this flags means that all questions about removing packages that are conflicts will automatically be answered YES.

#+begin_src bash
# Let's install each package listed in the pkglist.txt file.
sudo pacman --needed --ask 4 -Sy - < pkglist.txt || error "Failed to install a required package from pkglist.txt."

#+end_src

* Copy configs over from /etc/dtos into $HOME
While it would be easier to make packages that could install DTOS configs directly to the appropriate places in the $HOME folder, pacman does not allow for this.  Pacman is not allowed to touch $HOME ever!  The better way to do this is to install the configs in /etc/skel which is the standard directory to place such config files, but on many distros (for ex. Manjaro and Arco) /etc/skel is already used to store the distro's own config files.  So to avoid conflicts, all DTOS configs are placed in /etc/dtos and then copied over to $HOME.  A backup of config is created.  BEWARE!

=NOTE:= The /etc/dtos directory contains files and directories that are automatically copied over to a new user's home directory when such user is created by the 'useradd' or the 'adduser' program, depending on your Linux distro.

#+begin_src bash
printf  "%s\n" "## Copying DTOS configuration files from /etc/dtos into \$HOME"

# If these directories or files exist, the DTOS installation will make a backup of them.

# Make the ~/.config directory if it doesn't exist, or backup the ~/.config directory if it does exist.
